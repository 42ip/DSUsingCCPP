# Recursion

Recursion follows the **function call** mechanism which ends up taking more memory but is an efficient method in programming.

This problem includes _Binary search_ and _Greatest common divisor (GCD)_ using **recursion**. *(recursive method)*


## Binary search 

binary search is a search algorithm where it finds the position of the target value within the array.

## GCD

GCD or greatest common divisor is the highest common factor of any two or more integers.
