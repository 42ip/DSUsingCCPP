# Recursion

Recursion follows the **function call** mechanism which ends up taking more memory but is an efficient method in programming.

This problem includes _Binary search_ and _Greatest common divisor (GCD)_ using **recursion**. *(recursive method)*


## Binary search 

binary search is a search algorithm where it finds the position of the target value within the array.

## GCD

GCD or greatest common divisor is the highest common factor of any two or more integers.


## Tower of Hanoi
### Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
